My opinions about art.

Art is not static, it never has been. It is dynamic, huge and beautiful. Black squares have a meaning and were never thought of before Malevich said hey, why not? We have no more black squares because black squares have been done before. I have never seen a sculpture that is simply a stool with an upside-down stool on top of it, which is now inside the room. I call it "the Value Of Numbers".

I believe that if one were to paint a line on a canvas and call it "minimalism" then that is silly. Low effort. If one were to put stroke on top of stroke on top of stroke until it reaches the hundreds? Until it stick out of the canvas? Marvelous.
Art is effort. It is presenting an idea through things that are either audial or visual, so that it pleases our beautiful brains.
